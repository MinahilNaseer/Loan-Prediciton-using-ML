Loan Prediction Project

This project is a Machine Learning-based solution to predict loan eligibility based on customer details provided during the application process. It uses various features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and others to predict whether a loan should be approved.

Overview

The goal of this project is to assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process by predicting loan eligibility based on applicant data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system can provide faster, more accurate decisions, reducing the workload on human evaluators.

Key Objectives:

Automate the loan approval process.

Provide consistent and reliable predictions.

Improve efficiency in decision-making.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and normalizes numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into the data through visualizations and statistical summaries.

Model Training: Implements and compares multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to select the best-performing model.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model performance using techniques such as Grid Search or Randomized Search.

Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for model assessment.

Deployment Ready: Code structured for easy integration into deployment pipelines.
